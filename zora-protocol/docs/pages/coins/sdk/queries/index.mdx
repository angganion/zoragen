# Coin Queries

The Coins SDK provides a comprehensive set of query functions to fetch information about coins, profiles, and related data. This page details the available query functions, their parameters, and usage examples.

## Overview

The query functions are divided into several categories:

1. **[Coin Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/coin)**: Retrieve information on specific coins such as metadata, market data, and comments
2. **[Profile Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/profile)**: Retrieve information associated with users/wallets like holdings and activity
3. **[Explore Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/explore)**: Retrieve information about all coins (new, trending, top gainers, etc.)
4. **[Onchain Queries](/coins/sdk/queries/onchain)**: Fetch data directly from the blockchain (API strongly recommended, only recommended for advanced users)

## API Key Setup

Before using the API queries in a high-usage production environment, you'll need to set up an API key:

```ts twoslash
import { setApiKey } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

// Set up your API key
setApiKey("your-api-key-here");
```

To set up an API key:
1. Create an account on [Zora](https://zora.co)
2. Navigate to [Zora Developer Settings](https://zora.co/settings/developer)
3. Create an API key
4. Use the API key in the SDK


## Non-Javascript Usage

The Coins SDK API can be used in any language that supports HTTP requests.

Full API documentation can be found [on the SDK site](https://api-sdk.zora.engineering/docs) with a dynamic editor and an openapi definition file.

It's strongly recommended to use the authentication header for `api-key` with all requests to this API.

The paths and function names map directly to the SDK functions which can be used to document the usage of these API paths.
