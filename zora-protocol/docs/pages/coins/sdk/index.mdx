# Coins SDK

## Getting started

The Coins SDK is a library that allows you to create, manage, and query data for Zora coins.

Most features available on the Zora product on web and native mobile apps are available in the SDK and API.

## Installation

This SDK is designed to work with both client and server environments running both js and typescript.

The SDK can be installed from NPM by running:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @zoralabs/coins-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install @zoralabs/coins-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install @zoralabs/coins-sdk
```

```bash [bun]
bun install @zoralabs/coins-sdk
```

:::


Additionally, the SDK requires `viem` to be installed as a peer dependency:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install viem 
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install viem 
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install viem 
```

```bash [bun]
bun install viem 
```

:::


On-chain write operations will not work without `viem` installed.

## Usage

The SDK integrates with `fetch` and `viem` for on-chain interactions and writes.

It can be used on both client and server environments.

## API Key

The Coins SDK should be used with an API key to prevent rate limiting and unlock all features.

To set up your API key:
1. Log in or create an account on [Zora](https://zora.co)
2. Navigate to [Developer Settings on Zora](https://zora.co/settings/developer)
3. Create an API key
4. Use the API key in the SDK

The API key can be set using the `setApiKey` function:

```ts twoslash
import { setApiKey } from "@zoralabs/coins-sdk";

// Set up your API key before making any SDK requests
setApiKey("your-api-key-here");
```
